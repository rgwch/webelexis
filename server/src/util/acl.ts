/**
 * Access control system:
 * - Every resource is protected by a number of Access Control Elements (ACE). There are distinct ACEs for
 * reading, writing, updating and deleting such a resource.
 *
 * - Every ACE has a parent ACE or ist the root Element.
 *
 * - Every user has one or more roles. At least they have the role `roles.guest`.
 *
 * - Every role has zero or more ACEs.
 *
 * - If a user wants to access a resource method, they must have the corresponding ACE (e.g. konktakt.find).
 *  They have an ACE, if one of their roles has this ACE or a parent (or grandparent and so on) of this ACE.
 *
 * - A user who is member of the group `roles.admin` implicitely has all ACEs (i,e, has the ACE "root"
 *  which is by convention ancestor of all other ACEs).
 *
 * Roles are installation specific and therefore are defined in config/roles.js
